/**
** handle_heredoc_sigint - Handler for Ctrl+C during heredoc input
**
** BEHAVIOR:
**   Sets the global signal flag. The rl_event_hook will detect this
**   and set rl_done to interrupt readline().
**
** WHY DIFFERENT FROM handle_sigint:
**   During heredoc, we DON'T want to redisplay the prompt.
**   We just want to cancel the heredoc and return to main prompt.
**   The rl_event_hook mechanism cleanly interrupts readline().
**
** EXIT CODE:
**   Heredoc interruption should result in exit status 130.
**
**   sig - Signal number (SIGINT = 2)

/**
** heredoc_event_hook - Readline event hook for heredoc signal checking
**
** DESCRIPTION:
**   This function is called periodically by readline() when set as
**   rl_event_hook. It checks if SIGINT was received and interrupts
**   readline by setting rl_done to 1.
**
** TECHNICAL DETAILS:
**   rl_event_hook is called between characters during readline().
**   It's safe to check our global variable here and interrupt readline.
**   Setting rl_done = 1 causes readline() to return NULL immediately.
**
** RETURN VALUE:
**   Always returns 0 (required by readline)

/**
** setup_heredoc_signals - Configure signals for heredoc mode
**
** DESCRIPTION:
**   Sets up signal handlers and readline hook for heredoc input.
**   - SIGINT uses special handler that doesn't redisplay prompt
**   - SIGQUIT is ignored (standard bash behavior)
**   - rl_event_hook is set to check for signals periodically
**
** IMPORTANT:
**   Must call restore_interactive_signals() after heredoc completes
**   to restore normal signal handling!
